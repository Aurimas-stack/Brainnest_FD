      <h1>Deadlift</h1>
      <p>
        The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or
        bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso
        perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It
        is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and
        bench press. Depending on which style one chooses to use, different
        muscles will be targeted. For example, with a conventional stance, the
        back, hamstrings, and glutes will be targeted primarily. With a sumo
        stance, the quads and glutes will be primarily targeted.
