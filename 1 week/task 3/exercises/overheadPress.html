      <h1>Overhead Press</h1>
      <p>
        The overhead press is revered for its brute-strength production and
        renowned for its seeming simplicity. Just press a barbell, or one of its
        cousin 'bells, from the top of your chest to its overhead, arms-extended
        destination. That's the lift in a nutshell, and the juiciest fruits of
        your overhead labor are unmatched shoulder and upper-back development.
        Of course, the brute strength developed by the standing overhead
        pressing reaches far beyond the shoulders and arms. Full-body engagement
        builds full-body strength. The standing overhead press also builds the
        abdominal wall, strengthens the hips, and builds stability through the
        legs. But we can't forget the main targets: the shoulders, upper back,
        and triceps. Search the world over and you won't find another exercise
        that dramatically develops the shoulders and upper back like the
        overhead press. Even though the overhead press is simple to describe,
        it's actually a relatively technical lift that should be approached
        intelligently, practiced, and mastered. Here's how to get it done.
