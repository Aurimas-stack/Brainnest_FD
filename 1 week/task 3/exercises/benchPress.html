      <h1>Bench Press</h1>
      <p>
        The bench press, or chest press, is an upper-body weight training
        exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a
        weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the
        anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A
        barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells
        can also be used.The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the
        sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and squat, and is the only
        lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used
        extensively in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of
        training to develop the chest muscles. Bench press strength is important
        in combat sports as it tightly correlates to punching power. Bench press
        can also help contact athletes increase their performance because it can
        increase effective mass and functional hypertrophy of the upper body.
